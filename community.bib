 abstract = {Prompted by the increasing interest in networks in many fields, we present an attempt at unifying points of view and analyses of these objects coming from the social sciences, statistics, probability and physics communities. We apply our approach to the Newman-Girvan modularity, widely used for "community" detection, among others. Our analysis is asymptotic but we show by simulation and application to real examples that the theory is a reasonable guide to practice.},
